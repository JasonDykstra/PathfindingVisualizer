# PathfindingVisualizer

This is a small project I worked on during my Algorithms class at WPI. I wanted to visualize what was happening with A* pathfinding, so I made a program to do just that. 

The website is currently hosted on http://users.wpi.edu/~jpdykstra/ as of Nov 17, 2020. 

## Usage

Besides the buttons at the top of the grid to create start and end nodes, you can click or drag on the grid to create barrier nodes, or obstacles. The pathfinding algorithm will treat these black squares as impassable walls.
